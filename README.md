# custom-kernel

The support for ES8336 is now upstreamed.

See https://github.com/thesofproject/linux/wiki/ES8336-support if you want to compile your custom kernel.

For binary kernel, see https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v6.1-rc1/

This repository now contains a shell script which installs firmware/tplg and ucm for old Ubuntu versions.
